Sobol
Sobol total order coefficents with respect to area under the ROTEM curve for N=5000. The area under the curve was largely controlled by the fibrin control parameters (far right) and by the rate constant for generation of fibrin by fibrinogen, as catalyzed by fibrin (k_cat_fibrinogen). Since thrombin catalyzes fibrin generation, k_inhibition_ATIII, the rate constant that controls how quickly thrombin is deactivated by anithrombin also plays a large role in determining the area under ROTEM curve, as do the the parameters that control initiation (trigger control parameters).
